His early formative years were spent in St. George where he attended the Grand Anse R.C. School (1937-1943).  In 1943 he was enrolled in the St. John’s R.C. School, Gouyave and was admitted to Class V  where he excelled at his studies.
<br>His career choice in teaching began at the Pupil Teacher Training Centre (1947-1949), then furthered at the Grenada Teachers’ College (1964 to 1965).  During this period Mr. Glean worked as a Primary School Teacher at the St. John’s R.C. School, Principal at the Happy Hill R.C. School, Acting Principal at the St. John’s Christian Secondary School and Tutor at the Grenada Teacher’s Training College.
</span><br><span style="font-style: normal;">He went on to further his studies at the University of Calgary, Canada (1967 – 1970) where he achieved a Bachelor of Education Degree and a Master of Arts Degree in Education majoring in Curriculum and Instruction with emphasis in Social Studies (1972 -1973).
<br>On his return to the Grenada Teacher’s College in 1973, he was appointed Vice-Principal then Principal in 1974.  Mr. Glean was appointed as the first Lecturer in Social Studies Education at the Faculty of Education, University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus in December 1976.  In that capacity he worked closely with the Social Studies Tutors at the Teacher’s Colleges in the OECS and Barbados. 
</span><br><span style="font-style: normal;">With his interest in classroom interaction he applied for and was awarded a British Council Scholarship in 1981 to pursue a Master of Arts Degree in Education at the Department of Applied Research, University of East Anglia, U.K. After successfully completing the programme in 1982, he returned to the Cave Hill campus where he became a member of the Social Studies panel of the Caribbean Examination Council (C.X.C.) and an Assistant Chief Examiner (1979-1984).
<br>In 1986, Mr. Glean returned to Grenada where he entered the political arena serving as chairman of the National Democratic Congress party in the constituency of St. John. He acted as Senator and Minister of Education (1990-1995) while serving as Leader of Government Business (1990-1991).  He became the Senior Opposition Senator after the 1995 General Elections and resigned from the senate in 1998.  Mr. Glean also served as General Secretary and Deputy Chairman of the National Democratic Congress</span>.
<br><span style="font-style: normal;">Mr. Glean was actively involved in social activities within his community and country in the 1950’s.  He was a facilitator/tutor of the Sea Folks Club, Gouyave, and member of the Apex Boys Club and later on became a foundation member and secretary of the St. John’s Citizen Association (1961-1966) which sponsored games and cultural activities that were used to fund scholarship for needy students to attend secondary school.
</span><br><span style="font-style: normal;">He also served as a volunteer at the New Life Organisation (1995-2003), working with trainees in the Adolescent Development Programme in the area of Family Life Education and Social Studies and as Chairman of the Hillsview Home Management Committee (1997-2007).
